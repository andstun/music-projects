# music-projects

## Description

A collection of my music projects that I create in my spare time. These are not original compositions, they are covers often with some creative flair thrown in that differs from the original versions. All arranging, performance, and mixing was done from scratch without any external resources. In particular, the mixing was done using GarageBand.

## Usage

Please do not repost this content but feel free to download to your own music library (I would be honoured). Every mp3 file is its own project, it's just that some are missing garageband files because they were lost while importing from another device. Hope you enjoy!
